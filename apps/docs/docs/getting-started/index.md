# Getting Started

## Welcome

Welcome to the Mobiux Labs Forms documentation. This library, built with TypeScript and React, offers a powerful and flexible solution for creating and managing dynamic forms in your applications.

## Why?

Creating consistent, well-styled forms with validation and interdependent fields has historically been challenging. Each project often required a custom form renderer, leading to limitations and inconsistencies when reused across different projects. Mobiux Labs Forms addresses these challenges by providing a generic form renderer capable of handling both basic and complex forms, ensuring consistent styling and robust validation.

## Features

- **Dependent Fields**: Easily manage fields that rely on the values of other fields.
- **Dynamic Form Validation**: Implement flexible validation rules that adapt to form changes.
- **Custom Fields**: Extend the form renderer with custom field types to meet specific requirements.

## Overview

Mobiux Labs Forms consists of several key components:

- **Form Renderer**: The core library that renders forms based on a defined schema.
- **Field Extensions**: Additional libraries that introduce new field types, enhancing the form renderer's capabilities.
- **Form Builder**: A tool for generating schemas, simplifying the design and implementation of complex forms.

## Dependencies

Mobiux Labs Forms relies on the following:

- **React**: Ensures a modern and efficient UI.
- **React Hook Form**: Manages form state and validation, offering a performant and flexible solution.
