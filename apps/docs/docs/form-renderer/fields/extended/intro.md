# Extended Fields

Extended Fields are special components designed for `@mobiux-labs/form-core` that add extra fields to your forms. These fields rely on additional packages, so they're offered as separate libraries. This approach keeps the core package small and efficient. By using only the fields you need, you can maintain a minimal bundle size while still having a powerful form renderer.

Explore Extended Fields to enhance your forms with advanced features and customize them to fit your needs.
